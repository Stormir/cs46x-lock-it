## Summary
Lock It aims to provide a safe space for users when finding their match. Whether it be a romantic partner, best friend, or looking for a casual hookup, Lock It will ensure a transparent, respectful, and secure environment where users can connect with confidence and clear intentions.

## Objectives

### Core Experience
- Three separate channels with individual profiles that set clear intentions. Users can utilize Lock It to find a romantic partner (Dating Channel), best friend (BFF Channel), and a casual friends-with-benefits (FWB Channel).
- Ability to hide/deactivate profiles and/or delete account (with limited data retention for moderation)
- Standard features: viewing, swiping, matching, messaging.
- Limit on daily like and time limit between each swipe to encourage meaningful engagement.
- Robust filters: age, gender, sexuality, distance, race/ethnicity, children (have/want), education, religion/spirituality, political affiliation, last active date, etc.
- Selected categories displayed "above the fold," with the rest in an expandable section
- Minimum word count for bios
- Profiles inactive for over a month automatically hidden
- Simple algorithm based on past likes/matches (not AI matchmaking, can be turned off)

### Safety and Trust

- AI verification of profile pictures
- AI pre-screening of pictures sent in chat, with consent required before displaying
- Post-date surveys where users can report safety and identity concerns
- Location sharing with trusted contacts during dates
- Safe, accessible, private reporting as well as unmatching and blocking
- Community Guidelines page outlining behavior expectations

### Support

- Resources page with articles on consent, boundaries, empathy, safety, profile tips, etc.
- Feedback page for user concerns and suggestions

### Business / Tech

- Subscription-based with a single membership tier and a one-month free trial
- Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture for accessibility across devices

## Motivations
> Today’s dating culture is filled with stories of catfishing, unsafe encounters, and the anxiety that can come with meeting someone new.
> Having used platforms like Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble while genuinely looking for connection — for romance and friends — I can say
> I've seen firsthand how gaps in safety, moderation, and transparency can leave people vulnerable to those hiding behind a screen.
> But we believe dating apps can be better!
> Instead of only celebrating rare success stories, our mission is to create a space where safe, honest, and meaningful connections
> are the norm—where finding a trusted “Lock It” match feels natural, expected, and empowering.
